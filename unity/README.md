# Unity Plug-in

The MuJoCo Unity plug-in allows the Unity Editor and runtime to use the MuJoCo
physics engine.  Users can import MJCF files and edit the models in the Editor.
The plug-in relies on Unity for most aspects -- assets, game logic, simulation
time -- but uses MuJoCo to determine how objects move, giving the designer
access to MuJoCo's full API.  See documentation and installation instructions
[here](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unity.html).

## Special Instructions:
#### M1 Macbook:
- Make directory `MuJoCo_v2.2` under `/Applications`
- Copy all files from **MuJoCo 2.2.x** release dmg into `/Applications/MuJoCo_v2.2`
